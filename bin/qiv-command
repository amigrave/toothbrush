### QUICK IMAGE VIEWER "qiv-command" file
### http://qiv.spiegl.de/
###
### This file will be launched by QIV if you push 0-9 (or any other free key)
### NEW:  Now you can use all free keys for qiv-command.
### NEW:  If you press "X" followed by any string,
###       qiv-command is called with X and this string
###
### Just put it in a directory that is in your path
###
### Syntax: qiv-command [pushed_number] [image_filename_with_full_path]
###
### Note:
###  If the first line of the output is like "NEWNAME=xxxxxxx" then qiv
###  thinks that the filename of the currently displayed image has
###  changed to this new name and updates its internal filelist.
###  This is very useful when using qiv-command to rename files.
